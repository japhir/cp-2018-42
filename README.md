Currently under major revisions.

At present, only the R-scripts used to generate the data composite are reported, as well as the data sources used from the cited publications.

R-code used to generate the figures in the report require some cleaning up of the old code (not properly commented etc.), but will be added at some point.

The  LOSCAR  source  code  in  C can  be  obtained  from  the  author  by  sending  a  request  to loscar.model@gmail.com.

Model adjustments (implementation of astronomical forcing) are available upon request as patch files from i.j.kocken@uu.nl.
